Hacking together is much more fun, so let's find you a team.

## Hacker looking for a team

1.  Open a new issue using the template `Hacker wants team`. Here you can introduce yourself and tell potential teams why you're awesome. Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
2.  Browse all open issues with the label `Team wants hacker`.
3.  If you find a team with an idea that excites you, start engaging with the team. You can just comment in the issue. You should reference the issue from step 1 here, so that the team can learn a bit more about you.
4.  When you found a team please close your issue so that people know you have found a team.

## Team looking for a hacker

1.  Open a new issue using the template `Team wants hacker`. Here you can pitch your idea and tell everyone why they should buidl it.  Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
2.  Wait for hackers to approach you or browse through the hacker profiles (all issues with the label `Hacker wants team`) and engage with them.
3.  When you found all the hackers you dreamed of and needed close your issue so that everyone knows you're set.

## Communication

Interacting through issues might be great to find an initial match, but you probably want to take the conversation off GitHub at some point. You could meet in the #buidlyourberlinteam chat on [Status](https://status.im/) or the hacker chat room on [Riot](https://matrix.to/#/!WTJBLneNDtLzLNlkmU:matrix.org). You can also just directly leave your personal Riot/Status address.
